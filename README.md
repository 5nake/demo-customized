# Customized Web-UI demo

This a demo of custom Web-UI built with Ajenti Core.

Entry point is the [``custom-web-ui``](https://github.com/ajenti/demo-customized/blob/master/custom-web-ui) script.

If you'd like to play with JS/CSS resource files, don't forget to rebuild them afterwards with ``make``. This requires the dev multitool (``sudo pip install -U ajenti-dev-multitool``).
